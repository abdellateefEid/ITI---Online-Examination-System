    Reference these images in your README file by using relative paths.

Hereâ€™s how you can structure your README with your colored icons:

### Key Points:
- **Store icons in a folder** within your repository (e.g., `assets/icons/`).
- **Reference the icons** using relative paths like `assets/icons/icon-name.png`.

This will allow you to use custom, colored icons from your repository while keeping the README clean and visually appealing!
